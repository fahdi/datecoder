# DateCoder Project - Cursor Configuration

## Project Overview
DateCoder is a web-based date format builder tool that helps developers create date format strings for PHP, Python, and JavaScript. It's a single-page HTML application with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

## Key Features
- Interactive date format builders with drag-and-drop functionality
- Support for PHP date(), Python strftime(), and JavaScript date formatting
- Pre-configured country-specific date formats (50+ formats)
- Real-time preview of formatted dates
- Language switching between PHP, Python, and JavaScript

## Architecture
- **index.html** - Single-page application containing all functionality
  - Embedded CSS styles (~270 lines)
  - JavaScript logic (~600 lines)
  - Multi-language support (PHP/Python/JavaScript)
  - Two-tab interface: Custom Format Builder and Country Formats

## Core Components
- **Language Switcher** - Dynamically changes UI and format examples
- **Format Builder** - Drag-and-drop interface for custom date formats
- **Country Formats** - Pre-configured formats for different countries with search
- **Real-time Preview** - Shows formatted output as users build formats

## Data Structure
- `countryFormats` array contains 47+ predefined formats with PHP, Python, and JavaScript equivalents
- `formatParts` array manages drag-and-drop format building
- Language-specific format conversion logic for real-time previews

## Multi-Language Support
The application supports three programming languages with dynamic switching:
- **PHP**: Uses `date()` function format codes (Y, m, d, H, i, s, etc.)
- **Python**: Uses `strftime()` format codes (%Y, %m, %d, %H, %M, %S, etc.)
- **JavaScript**: Uses custom format patterns (YYYY, MM, DD, HH, mm, ss, etc.)

## Development Guidelines
- All functionality is contained in a single HTML file
- CSS and JavaScript are embedded (no external dependencies)
- Use semantic HTML and modern CSS practices
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for JavaScript functions
- Ensure all three languages (PHP/Python/JavaScript) are supported for new features

## File Structure
```
datecoder/
├── index.html          # Main application file (contains everything)
├── favicon.ico         # Site favicon

├── deploy.py          # Production deployment script
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies for deployment
└── setup_env.sh       # Environment setup script
```

## Important Notes
- No build process required - direct HTML/CSS/JS deployment
- The application is self-contained in index.html
- All country formats must include PHP, Python, and JavaScript equivalents
- Real-time preview functionality is critical for user experience
- Maintain responsive design for mobile and desktop users
